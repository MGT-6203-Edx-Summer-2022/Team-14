### Information
This repository is intended to use for Team 14 - MGT6203 Summer 22 Group Project only

Our goal is to identify a portfolio of stocks which will outperform the market in a recession. To do so, we plan to leverage data for securities in the S&P 500 during the ‘Great Recession’ (period of December 2007 – June 2009), to better understand factors which are indicative of resilience during economic downturns. We will then use these findings to infer which securities may be strong investments during the present period of economic uncertainty. 

### Installation
---
Stocks and some factors data:
tidyquant package: install.packages("tidyquant")

Working with data:
tidyverse package: install.packages("tidyverse")

### Configuration
---
Use Temp.RData for saved variables data (latest run on code)

### Limitation
---
Since we only utilize free access to databases, we don't have the most accurated list of SP500 historical data as well as the institution details information such as their stock price, market cap, sector, etc.
We do our best to gather as much as free available information for all the SP500 institutions from all sources. However, this has the most impact on the accuracy the outcome.
