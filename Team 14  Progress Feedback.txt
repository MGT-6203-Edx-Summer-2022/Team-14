Progress Report and Video Feedback: Team 14
Parth Gada

I liked the way you presented your video, although I would have liked to see a lot more of the EDA you did, along with your data sources. I also would have liked to seen more visualizations and charts to complement your video and report, to make it easier to understand. Like I had said during the proposal, I am a bit skeptical of only using the great recession as a basis for creating a recession proof portfolio; it would be great if you could use other recession periods like the dot com bubble, or small bear runs to justify your portfolio. Also focus a bit more on making the report more detailed than it already is. 

As always, if you would like to discuss anything further, feel free to ping/email me or schedule a meetting at pgada7@gatech.edu.
