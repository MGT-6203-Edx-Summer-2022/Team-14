### Information
This repository is intended to use for Team 14 - MGT6203 Summer 22 Group Project only

Our goal is to identify a portfolio of stocks which will outperform the market in a recession. To do so, we plan to leverage data for securities in the S&P 500 during the ‘Great Recession’ (period of December 2007 – June 2009), to better understand factors which are indicative of resilience during economic downturns. We will then use these findings to infer which securities may be strong investments during the present period of economic uncertainty.
